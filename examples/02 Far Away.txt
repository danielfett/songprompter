CAPO 2      4x Em G C C

Im wandering around see the faces passing by
Of hollow ghosts in ancient times
Theyre stuck into a mess of black and white
Praying for forgiveness of their crimes

2x Em G C C

In their feverdreams they see nothing like a wall
Of black burned concrete shattered on the ground
No chance to break out and forget about it all
Theyre running down the roads to the port of call

Bridge 2x  D  Em  C  G	
You aint got nothing left to lose and to leave behind
So come onboard and get your oneway ticked signed 

Chorus  D  D  C  Em
Were sailing far away on the seas of life 4x
---
2x Em G C C

Pale faces dreaming of the promised land
No chance to change it nothing in between
Dead end streets and broken hopes and dreams
theyve got a vision an image nice and clean

Far in the distance a ship lies at the bay
The crew sets sails to that faraway land
colours of freedom waving on their flag
leaving with gods wisdom on command

Bridge 2x  D  Em  C  G	
You aint got nothing left to lose and to leave behind
So come onboard and get your oneway ticked signed 

Chorus  D  D  C  Em
Were sailing far away on the seas of life 4x

Solo 4x Em G C C Pascal

Bridge 2x  D  Em  C  G	NUR GITARRE UN DRUMS
You aint got nothing left to lose and to leave behind
So come onboard and get your oneway ticked signed 

Chorus  D  D  C  Em
Were sailing far away on the seas of life 4x
